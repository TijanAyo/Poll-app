# Purpose
The main purpose of trying out this app is to get myself familar with documentations... In what sense (you might ask )

Getting started with a new framework or technology can be overwhelming at times and getting answers to particular issues can be dauting especially if the framework you are using is that popular... surfing the web for hours and not getting the answer you seek can be a huge turn off.

Sometimes or most of the times the answers you are looking for can be in the documentation of the framework or technology you currently use. <br >
Hence the purpose of this Poll App is to see how well i can complete an app with django with little or no help from other third party source(s).<br >

 To my surprise it actually went better than i expected, i never knew the Django documentation was this rich of information and solution. Problems or issues that would have taken me hours to solve have been categorized accordingly and sequencially into their vast Pool of information(Their Website).

# Summary
Too many people get so excited to write code that they sometimes forget to put in their due diligence. Writing code is fun and I too have been guilty of ignoring the documentation. With old tools, or new, there will always be more to learn. You will save yourself a lot of time and energy if you make sure you have a good foundation before diving into a new tool.
